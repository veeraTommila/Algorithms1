## Demo task number 1.

Design an algorithm that checks whether an integer is evenly divisible by another integer without using any division operations.

[Demo1](https://github.com/veeraTommila/Algorithms1/blob/main/EvenlyDivisibleProject/Program.cs)

This task focuses on cheking. First, we have to find out that the given numbers a, b, and c are integers. There are no commas or periods in integers. Multiply the integers b and c together so that the result is a. Do this by comparing the products b * c and c * b with each other. Everything is fine if the products are the same for both.
